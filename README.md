# Simon Game

Welcome to the Simon Game! This is a simple yet challenging game where you have to repeat a sequence of colored buttons that the computer generates.

## How to Play

1. Press any key to begin the game.
2. The computer will generate a random sequence of colored buttons, which you must repeat by clicking on the corresponding buttons.
3. If you repeat the sequence correctly, the computer will add another button to the sequence, and you must repeat the new, longer sequence.
4. The game ends when you make a mistake and fail to repeat the sequence correctly.
5. You can pause the game by clicking on the "Pause" button, and resume it by clicking on the "Resume" button.

## Tips

- Pay close attention to the sequence, and take your time repeating it.
- Try to memorize the sequence as it is being played, rather than relying on the buttons lighting up to remind you of the sequence.
- Take a break if you feel like you're getting overwhelmed, and come back to the game with a fresh mind.

## Technologies Used

- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript/JQuery
